# Employee Blocked Times - Tests Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully created comprehensive tests for the Employee Blocked Times feature, specifically testing the `normalizeBlockedTimesForEmployees` function in `calendarUtils.ts`.

## Test File

`src/services/calendar/calendarService.blockedTimes.spec.ts`

## Test Coverage

### 1. Single-day Blocked Time (4 tests)
- ✅ Normalize single blocked time slot with specific hours
- ✅ Normalize all-day blocked time using employee working hours
- ✅ Skip all-day blocks when employee not found in period
- ✅ Skip all-day blocks when day not found in period

### 2. Multi-day Blocked Time with `group_id` (2 tests)
- ✅ Normalize vacation with multiple all-day blocked days (same `group_id`)
- ✅ Handle partial-day vacation (first day from 10:00, last day until 14:00)

### 3. Multiple Employees (1 test)
- ✅ Normalize blocked times for different employees independently

### 4. Edge Cases (2 tests)
- ✅ Return empty array when no blocked times provided
- ✅ Still normalize specific time blocks even when period is empty

## Test Results

```
Test Suites: 2 passed (calendarService.blockedTimes.spec.ts + calendarUtils.spec.ts)
Tests:       73 passed total
  - 9 new tests for blocked times
  - 64 existing tests (all still passing)
```

## Key Findings During Testing

### 1. All-Day vs Specific Time Logic
The function treats `isAllDay` blocks and specific time blocks differently:
- **All-day blocks** require both the day AND employee to be in the period (skipped if not found)
- **Specific time blocks** are normalized regardless of period (filtered later in the pipeline)

This is **intentional behavior** - specific time blocks are added to the normalized appointments array and filtered out later by `combinePeriodWithNormalizedAppointments`.

### 2. Timezone Handling
- All blocked times are stored in **Europe/Berlin** timezone in the database
- The function correctly converts them to **UTC** for internal processing
- MySQL `DATE` fields are returned as JavaScript `Date` objects at midnight UTC
- The function properly formats these using `dayjs().format('YYYY-MM-DD')` before using them

### 3. Type Safety
- Used real TypeScript types from the project: `EmployeeBlockedTimeData`, `PeriodWithEmployeeWorkingTimeType`
- Working times must be `dayjs.Dayjs` objects, not plain `Date` objects
- All tests use proper type annotations and match production code exactly

## Integration with Calendar Service

These tests confirm that:
1. Blocked times are correctly normalized into the same format as appointments and Google Calendar events
2. The normalized data can be added to `allNormalizedAppointments` in `calendarService.ts`
3. The existing `combinePeriodWithNormalizedAppointments` function will properly handle them
4. Multi-day vacations with `group_id` are processed correctly (each day as a separate entry)

## Next Steps

The tests are ready for production. The blocked times feature is fully tested at the normalization layer. Integration with the full calendar service flow (`getGroupedTimeSlots`) is already working in production as confirmed by the user.

## Files Modified

- ✅ **Created**: `src/services/calendar/calendarService.blockedTimes.spec.ts` (9 new tests)
- ✅ **Verified**: All existing tests in `src/services/calendar/calendarUtils.spec.ts` still pass (64 tests)
- ✅ **Used**: Real production types from `calendarUtils.ts` and `employeesBlockedTimesService.ts`
